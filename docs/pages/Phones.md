# Phones

In order to run AndroidAPS you will need an Android phone most reasonably new phones will do and you can find a list of ones that people have tried and used below:

If you are planning to use a Combo pump you will need to use either Android 8.1 or install LineageOS 14.1 on the phone. LineageOS is an open source version of Android and is freely and widely available. If you're not up for installing it yourself you should be able to easily find a phone "geek" who can, but you need to be aware that some phones are "locked down" by the service provider and you won't be able to use them.
